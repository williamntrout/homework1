# homework1

The assigned project was to review and adjust the given piece of work with the intention of making the code more readable and organized, insure the site adheres to accessibility standards, and optimize the site for search engine results.

The main action I took was to a look at the code and ask if it made sense to the reader and flowed simply and easily so that it could be understood by someone, such as myself, with even a small amount of knowledge.  I took as many of the DIVs out as I could and used semantic terms to group the elements together in clusters that could be named and labeled similarly, if not identically. I did this to make it possible to limit the number of entries on the CSS page.  I felt it was better to limit minimize the number of places a mistake or conflict could occur if I could use on css set to style multiple occurrences should they have the same appearance.  

We also labeled all of the pictures and graphics in order to make it easier for the reader to identify the images even though they may not be viewable.  

I believe the action items we performed meet the criteria of the assignment.
